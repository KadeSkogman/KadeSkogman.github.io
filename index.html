        <h2> My Favorite Things:  </h2>
    <ul>
         <li>Music/Band: My favorite music is any music really. I listen to 
         Rap, Country, Indie, 90's, etc. Ive always enjoyed music because
         it helps me concentrate on whatever im working on.</li>
         <li>Color: My favorite color is red. Ive always loved the color
         red but i dont think i could ever have a bright red car or
         have a red house unless the reason my house was red is because
         its made of brick.</li>
        <li>Food: Food is broad but i would have to say bar food. Im a fan of 
        the classic greasy burger and chicken fingers and fries. My other favorites 
        that follow close behind are italian or mexican though.</li>
