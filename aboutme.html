        <h4>My name is Kade Skogman. I am a student at High Point University located
            in High Point North Carolina and im pursuing a degree in Social Media and Digital Communications.
            I am originally from a small town in Iowa called Marion which has a population 
            of about 45,000 people.
            I lived in Marion until I graduated Washington High School in 2022. My junior 
            year of hish school i was still unsure if wanted to attend college and my 
            parents finally convinced me to attened a two year community college which had 
            became my plan. I was soon convinced to come visit High Point and I immediately
            fell in love. Little did I know I would end up moving to High Point for the 
            school year and head back home during the summers. I enjoy  hiking and spending 
            time with friends and family. After graduating from HPU, I plan to work for the
            family real estate company back at home and get into land development.</h4>
