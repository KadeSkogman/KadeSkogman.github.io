        <h1>About Me Page</h1>

        <h4>
            My name is Kade Skogman. I am a student at High Point University located
            in High Point, North Carolina, and I'm pursuing a degree in Social Media and Digital Communications.
            I am originally from a small town in Iowa called Marion, which has a population 
            of about 45,000 people.
            I lived in Marion until I graduated from Washington High School in 2022.
            My junior year of high school, I was still unsure if I wanted to attend college,
            and my parents finally convinced me to attend a two-year community college, which had 
            become my plan. I was soon convinced to visit High Point, and I immediately
            fell in love. Little did I know I would end up moving to High Point for the 
            school year and going back home during the summers.
            I enjoy hiking and spending time with friends and family. After graduating from HPU,
            I plan to work for my family real estate company back home and get into land development.
