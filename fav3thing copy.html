    <h2>downhillskiing</h2>

    <h3> ive always had a passion for skiing. i was taught how to ski at a very 
    young age and have loved it ever since. skiing is a great way to get outside
    and enjoy the winter weather. it is also a great way to spend time with your 
    family

    <h2>cars</h2> 

    <h3> I blame my strong addiction to cars on the animated movie Cars. i remember 
        watching it as a kid and immediatley wanting to go play with my hot wheels
        or RC cars. Cars are still something that consumes my free time back at 
        home. all my friends are into them as well so were always going to car shows
        or working on them.

    <h2>fishing</h2> 

    <h3> Some of my favorite memories growing up are based around fishing. whether
        it was with my dad, grandpa, or papa, fishing was always a great time. i loved 
        going and hanging out with them because it was a great way to spend time together
        and learn a life long skill. still to this day i love going fishing with my family
        as well as getting my friends "hooked" on it.
